# Iyo's Portfolio Website

This portfolio breaks away from the typical “scrolling” personal website. Instead, it offers a **playful, interactive terminal experience** where visitors explore a mini terminal-like environment to learn about my work, background, and blog.

It's not just a website; it's a concept that speaks to **creativity, technical fluency, and personality**.

## Key Concept

Visitors essentially "play" with a simulated command-line interface to:
- Run commands
- Navigate a virtual filesystem
- Access data like `portfolio`, `contact`, and more

It's delightful for tech-savvy users, **memorable for recruiters**, and surprisingly fun for casual visitors.

For those who don’t have time or get confused by typed commands, a helpful `help` command and **GUI switch** make sure everyone can quickly find the info they need.
