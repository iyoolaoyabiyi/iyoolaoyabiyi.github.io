# Who Am I?
My name is Iyọ̀ and I'm a web developer based in Nigeria.

## Background & Evolution
I started my web development journey with vanilla **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. 
Over time, I expanded into WordPress development and gained proficiency in additional technologies like, **SQL**, **SASS**, **NodeJS**, **MongoDB** and frameworks and libraries like **Express**, **ReactJS** and **Bootstrap**.
While I started as a front-end developer, I'm now transitioning toward backend and full-stack roles.

## Technical Profile: 
My tech stack includes both modern and legacy technologies. While I'm skilled with contemporary tools like React and NodeJS, I have a preference for legacy frameworks like Angular due to their stability. I continue to work effectively with Bootstrap, vanilla JavaScript, PHP, and WordPress. I'm particularly focused on mastering JavaScript as I believe it's crucial for my development goals.

## Communication & Writing: 
My approach to communication is influenced by my background in writing and poetry. I use note taking applications for composing longer messages, and rely on thesaurus and dictionary tools to maintain precision in my writing. I value professional, friendly, and concise communication in all interactions.

## Personal Values: 
I describe myself as creative, resourceful, and focused. My family serves as a strong source of motivation, and I maintain a careful balance between my professional ambitions and personal life. These values guide both my career choices and personal development goals.
