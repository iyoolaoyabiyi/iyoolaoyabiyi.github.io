> A playful and interactive portfolio site that mimics a terminal environment ‚Äî with a GUI fallback ‚Äî to explore my work, skills, and thoughts.

---

**Welcome to my terminal-inspired personal website!**  
Unlike traditional scrolling portfolios, this site invites users to _explore_, _navigate_, and _type_ their way around via a simulated shell.

## üîó Quick Access

- **Live Demo**: [iyoolaoyabiyi.github.io](https://iyoolaoyabiyi.github.io)

This portfolio breaks away from the typical ‚Äúscrolling‚Äù personal website. Instead, it offers a **playful, interactive terminal experience** where visitors explore a mini terminal-like environment to learn about my work and background.

It's not just a website; it's a concept that speaks to **creativity, technical fluency, and personality**.

## Key Concept

Visitors essentially "play" with a simulated command-line interface to:
- Run commands
- Navigate a virtual filesystem
- Access data like `portfolio`, `contact`, and more

It's delightful for tech-savvy users, hopefully **memorable for recruiters**, and surprisingly fun for casual visitors.

For those who don‚Äôt have time or get confused by typed commands, a helpful `help` command and **GUI switch** make sure everyone can quickly find the info they need.

## Features

- **Terminal interface** with responsive commands
- **GUI alternative** for quick access
- **Virtual filesystem** for realistic directory navigation
- Built-in commands: `echo`, `list`, `goto`, `open`, `clear`, `exit`, `help`, etc
- **Modal welcome** to orient first-time users
