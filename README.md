# 👋 Hi, I'm Iyo – Web & Software Developer

I'm a self-taught developer with a strong passion for building clean, accessible, and impactful digital products. I work primarily with modern web technologies — blending creativity and logic to craft smooth, user-centered interfaces and solid backend systems.

I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and constantly learning new technologies. My journey has taken me from static web pages to dynamic apps, component libraries, backend APIs, and cloud integration — and I’m still exploring.
